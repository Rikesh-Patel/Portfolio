# About
An aspiring data practitioner, I strive to generate reports that make data exciting and tackle emerging questions. Delivering quality, consistently.

# Mission Statement
Francis Bacon once said, "Knowledge is power." Now, centuries later, I say data is power. From my first moments with a computer in elementary school, I've had a fondness for number games. Games with rows upon rows of values itched the calculative part of my brain. Essentially to win these games, I needed to work to make the numbers larger, so I did everything from Google Sheets to Excel calculations, from putting a weight on my mouse to Python-scripting and macros; if it accrued more money, saved time, or got an achievement in the game, I would do it. The peak of this fascination was clicking 'Start' on a script and then lying back while some authority took ahold of my screen.

Without knowing it, this past time would lead me down the path of data modeling. This is all part of my grand schemeâ€”to underscore efficiencies, lionize strengths, and snip weaknesses for optimized results. To me, data unveils another dimension with limitless potential. I love creating, editing videos, writing story lines, and designing graphics, so with my foundation in Econometrics and working experience with data, I plan on making great strides.
